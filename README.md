# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio site I created that showcases some of the design and development projects I have worked on in the past. Because all my React web development work is on a private Github repo, I felt that I needed to create a project that would show off my coding skills in React.

## How I created this project

- The site design was created in Adobe Xd
- I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a boilerplate
- [React Router DOM](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router#readme) is used to make this a multi page application
- Component styled with [Styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- Responsive CSS styling is handled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Why I built this project this way

- I used Create React App because it is a very fast and easy way to setup dynamic routing in React. There is a lot less to setup going this route.
- React Router DOM is a package that I am familiar with and an easy way to implement dynamic routing.
- Styled-components allowed me to create components that are modular. Keeping the component and styling in one file while also maintaining readability.
- Leveraging Bootstrap grid I was able to setup a responsive column page structure without having to write a bunch of global styles.

## IF I had more time...

- I would like to update the Projects page and About page to reflect the styling that is on the home page
- Move this project to a more React friendly hosting platform (netlify, Vercel, etc).
- Add a blog section using a headless CMS for the backend

## Available Scripts

`npm start` - This will run the app in development mode, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in the browser.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production. Production ready files can be found in the `build` folder.
